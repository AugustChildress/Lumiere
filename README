SNoBoL: SuperNova Bolometric Lightcurves
========================================

Version 0.1

SNoBoL is a python package for calculating the bolometric luminosity of Type II
supernovae using observed photometry. Three different methods for calculating
the bolometric luminosity are currently included. Those are:

* **Quasi-bolometric**: converts observed magnitudes to monochromatic fluxes at
  the effective wavelengths of the filters, then integrates using the
  trapezoidal rule to get an approximation of the total observed flux.

* **Direct**: Calculates the quasi-bolometric lightcurve, then makes UV and IR
  corrections by fitting a blackbody curve to the fluxes, and integrating that
  function beyond the wavelength limits of the observations.

* **Bolometric Correction**: Performs a bolometric correction based on B-V, V-I,
  or B-I color, using the method of Bersten & Hamuy (2009).

Typical usage often looks like this::

    from snobol import sn

    my_supernova = sn.SN('sn1998a')
    my_supernova.lqbol()            # quasi-bolometric lightcurve
    my_supernova.lbol_direct_bh09() # direct lightcurve
    my_supernova.lbol_bc_bh09()     # bolometric correction lightcurve

Installation
============

Source code can be found at https://github.com/JALusk/SNoBoL

In order to install SNoBoL system-wide, use::

    python setup.py install

If you do not have root priviliges on your machine, then use::

    python setup.py install --user

Documentation
=============

Documentation is automatically generated via Sphinx.
To generate the documentation locally, navigate to the ``docs/`` directory and use::

    make html

This will generate html files in the ``docs/build/html/`` directory.
Double-clicking the ``index.html`` file should open the documentation in your
web browser.
